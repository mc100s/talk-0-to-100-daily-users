## Introduction

The goal of this course is to show you how to start a startup/project with web tools without any coding skills!

For this course, as a project example, we have decided to create a **marketplace for babysitters**, called **IronMoms**.

The value propositions are the following one:
- For parents: A quality babysitter available in 1 hour, with some previous experience
- For babysitters: A well paid babysitter job 

Don't focus too much of the UX/UI of the website, it was realised in just 1 hour to show it's very fast to create a website ðŸ˜‰

## Step 1 | Create your website with Wix

First, you have to create a website. For this, we will rely on Wix, that is intuitive, with free or cheap plans, and gives you a lot of flexibility in term of design.

In our example, we have decided to rely on the template available: [here](https://www.wix.com/website-template/view/html/2089?siteId=935a3b2f-412f-4726-ad42-a62e6e2d08c7&metaSiteId=e913f3bb-f280-450a-a39d-86c800979ab6&originUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wix.com%2Fwebsite%2Ftemplates%3Fcriteria%3Dbaby%26page%3D1).

After customizing Wix, this is our result: https://maxencebouret.wixsite.com/ironmoms

As you will see, the website has Wix advertissment and is on their own domain name. If you want to remove advertissement, you can subscribe to a Premium Plan for 8,50â‚¬ / month to remove it and have a free domain name. It still way cheaper than a Web Developer ðŸ’µ

## Step 2 | Create Wix forms

Forms are an important way to interact with user is to use forms. Thanks to them, your users can reach you and give you many informations.

To create a form on Wix, on need to click "+" and select "Conctact".

Then, when you have created all your fields for your form, you need to connect it.

## Step 3 | Collect the data

Wix as a very nice interface where you can find the interactions between your users and your website.
